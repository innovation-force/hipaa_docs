<li><p><em>Sanitization</em>: Removal or the act of overwriting data to a point of preventing the recovery of the data on the device or media that is being sanitized. Sanitization is typically done before re-issuing a device or media, donating equipment that contained sensitive information or returning leased equipment to the lending company.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Trigger Event</em>: Activities that may be indicative of a security breach that require further investigation (See Appendix).</p></li>

<li><p><em>Restricted Area</em>: Those areas of the building(s) where protected health information and/or sensitive organizational information is stored, utilized, or accessible at any time.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Role</em>: The category or class of person or persons doing a type of job, defined by a set of similar or identical responsibilities.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Precursor</em>: A sign that an Incident may occur in the future. Examples of precursors include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Alerts from file integrity checking software;</li>
<li>Audit log alerts.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><em>Risk</em>: The likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability, and the impact of that event on the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of ePHI, other confidential or proprietary electronic information, and other system assets.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Risk Management Team</em>: Individuals who are knowledgeable about the Organization’s HIPAA Privacy, Security and HITECH policies, procedures, training program, computer system set up, and technical security controls, and who are responsible for the risk management process and procedures outlined below.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Risk Assessment</em>: (Referred to as Risk Analysis in the HIPAA Security Rule); the process:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identifies the risks to information system security and determines the probability of occurrence and the resulting impact for each threat/vulnerability pair identified given the security controls in place;</li>
<li>Prioritizes risks; and</li>
<li>Results in recommended possible actions/controls that could reduce or offset the determined risk.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><em>Risk Management</em>: Within this policy, it refers to two major process components: risk assessment and risk mitigation. This differs from the HIPAA Security Rule, which defines it as a risk mitigation process only. The definition used in this policy is consistent with the one used in documents published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p></li>

<li><p><em>Risk Mitigation</em>: Referred to as Risk Management in the HIPAA Security Rule, and is a process that prioritizes, evaluates, and implements security controls that will reduce or offset the risks determined in the risk assessment process to satisfactory levels within an organization given its mission and available resources.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Security Incident</em> (or just Incident): A security incident is an occurrence that exercises a significant adverse effect on people, process, technology, or data. Security incidents include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>A system or network breach accomplished by an internal or external entity; this breach can be inadvertent or malicious;</li>
<li>Unauthorized disclosure;</li>

<li>Other examples of observable information security incidents may include, but are not limited to:

<ul>
<li>Use of another person’s individual password and/or account to login to a system;</li>
<li>Failure to protect passwords and/or access codes (e.g., posting passwords on equipment);</li>
<li>Installation of unauthorized software;</li>
<li>Terminated workforce member accessing applications, systems, or network.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><em>Threat</em>: The potential for a particular threat-source to successfully exercise a particular vulnerability. Threats are commonly categorized as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Environmental – external fires, HVAC failure/temperature inadequacy, water pipe burst, power failure/fluctuation, etc.</li>
<li>Human – hackers, data entry, workforce/ex-workforce members, impersonation, insertion of malicious code, theft, viruses, SPAM, vandalism, etc.</li>

<li>Technological – server failure, software failure, ancillary equipment failure, etc. and environmental threats, such as power outages, hazardous material spills.</li>
<li>Other – explosions, medical emergencies, misuse or resources, etc.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><em>Threat Source</em>: Any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm (intentional or unintentional) to an IT system. Common threat sources can be natural, human or environmental which can impact the organization’s ability to protect ePHI.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Threat Action</em>: The method by which an attack might be carried out (e.g., hacking, system intrusion, etc.).</p></li>

<li><p><em>Unrestricted Area</em>: Those areas of the building(s) where protected health information and/or sensitive organizational information is not stored or is not utilized or is not accessible there on a regular basis.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Unsecured Protected Health Information</em>: Protected health information (PHI) that is not rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals through the use of technology or methodology specified by the Secretary in the guidance issued under section 13402(h)(2) of Pub. L.111-5 on the HHS website.</p>

<ol>
<li>Electronic PHI has been encrypted as specified in the HIPAA Security rule by the use of an algorithmic process to transform data into a form in which there is a low probability of assigning meaning without the use of a confidential process or key and such confidential process or key that might enable decryption has not been breached. To avoid a breach of the confidential process or key, these decryption tools should be stored on a device or at a location separate from the data they are used to encrypt or decrypt. The following encryption processes meet this standard.</li>
<li>Valid encryption processes for data at rest (i.e. data that resides in databases, file systems and other structured storage systems) are consistent with NIST Special Publication 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices.</li>
<li>Valid encryption processes for data in motion (i.e. data that is moving through a network, including wireless transmission) are those that comply, as appropriate, with NIST Special Publications 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations; 800-77, Guide to IPSec VPNs; or 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs, and may include others which are Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS 140-2 validated.</li>
<li>The media on which the PHI is stored or recorded has been destroyed in the following ways:</li>
<li>Paper, film, or other hard copy media have been shredded or destroyed such that the PHI cannot be read or otherwise cannot be reconstructed. Redaction is specifically excluded as a means of data destruction.</li>
<li>Electronic media have been cleared, purged, or destroyed consistent with NIST Special Publications 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, such that the PHI cannot be retrieved.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><p><em>Vendors</em>: Persons from other organizations marketing or selling products or services, or providing services to Innovation Force.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Vulnerability</em>: A weakness or flaw in an information system that can be accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited by a threat and lead to a compromise in the integrity of that system, i.e., resulting in a security breach or violation of policy.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Workstation</em>: An electronic computing device, such as a laptop or desktop computer, or any other device that performs similar functions, used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. Workstation devices may include, but are not limited to: laptop or desktop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), tablet PCs, and other handheld devices. For the purposes of this policy, “workstation” also includes the combination of hardware, operating system, application software, and network connection.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Workforce</em>: Means employees, volunteers, trainees, and other persons whose conduct, in the performance of work for a covered entity, is under the direct control of such entity, whether or not they are paid by the covered entity.</p></li>
