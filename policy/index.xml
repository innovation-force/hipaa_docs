&lt;p&gt;Innovation Force is proactive about information security and understands that vulnerabilities need to be monitored on an ongoing basis. Innovation Force utilizes the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.qualys.com/enterprises/qualysguard/web-application-scanning/&#34;&gt;Qualys Scanner&lt;/a&gt; to consistently scan, identify, and address vulnerabilities on our systems. We also utilize &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ossec.net/&#34;&gt;OSSEC&lt;/a&gt; on all systems, including logs, for file integrity checking and intrusion detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applicable-standards-from-the-hitrust-common-security-framework:fc4d8d28a19469b9b90fc058a01cf087&#34;&gt;Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10.m - Control of Technical Vulnerabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applicable-standards-from-the-hipaa-security-rule:fc4d8d28a19469b9b90fc058a01cf087&#34;&gt;Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;164.308(a)(8) - Evaluation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;vulnerability-scanning-policy:fc4d8d28a19469b9b90fc058a01cf087&#34;&gt;Vulnerability Scanning Policy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nessus management is performed by the Innovation Force Security Officer with assistance from the VP of Engineering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nessus is used to monitor all internal IP addresses (servers, VMs, etc) on Innovation Force networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frequency of scanning is as follows:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on a weekly basis;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after every production deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewing Nessus reports and findings, as well as any further investigation into discovered vulnerabilities, are the responsibility of the Innovation Force Security Officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of new vulnerabilities, the following steps are taken:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All new vulnerabilities are verified manually to assure they are repeatable. Those not found to be repeatable are manually tested after the next vulnerability scan, regardless of if the specific vulnerability is discovered again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vulnerabilities that are repeatable manually are documented and reviewed by the Security Officer, VP of Engineering, and Privacy Officer to see if they are part of the current risk assessment performed by Innovation Force.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those that are a part of the current risk assessment are checked for mitigations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those that are not part of the current risk assessment trigger a new risk assessment, and this process is outlined in detail in the Innovation Force Risk Assessment Policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All vulnerability scanning reports are retained for 6 years by Innovation Force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Penetration testing is performed regularly as part of the Innovation Force vulnerability management policy.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;External penetration testing is performed bi-annually by a third party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal penetration testing is performed quarterly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaps and vulnerabilities identified during penetration testing are reviewed, with plans for correction and/or mitigation, by the Innovation Force Security Officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Penetration tests results are retained for 6 years by Innovation Force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This vulnerability policy is reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Security Officer and Privacy Officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>System Access Policy</title>
      <link>http://innovation-force.github.io/hipaa_docs/policy/system_access_policy/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Access to Innovation Force systems and application is limited for all users, including but not limited to workforce members, volunteers, business associates, contracted providers, consultants, and any other entity, is allowable only on a minimum necessary basis. All users are responsible for reporting an incident of unauthorized user or access of the organization’s information systems. These safeguards have been established to address the HIPAA Security regulations including the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applicable-standards-from-the-hitrust-common-security-framework:fee7af67ddba58b11ccceda5b79ee9ee&#34;&gt;Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;01.d - User Password Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;01.f - Password Use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;01.r - Password Management System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;01.a - Access Control Policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;01.b - User Registration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;01.h - Clear Desk and Clear Screen Policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;01.j - User Authentication for External Connections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;01.q - User Identification and Authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;01.v - Information Access Restriction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;02.i - Removal of Access Rights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;06.e - Prevention of Misuse of Information Assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applicable-standards-from-the-hipaa-security-rule:fee7af67ddba58b11ccceda5b79ee9ee&#34;&gt;Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;164.308a3iiB Workforce Clearance Procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;164.308a4iiB Access Authorization&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;access-establishment-and-modification:fee7af67ddba58b11ccceda5b79ee9ee&#34;&gt;Access Establishment and Modification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requests for access to Innovation Force Platform systems and applications is made formally to the VP of Engineering, Privacy Officer, or Security Officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access is not granted until receipt, review, and approval by the Innovation Force Security Officer;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The request for access is retained for future reference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All access to Innovation Force systems and services are reviewed and updated on an bi-annual basis to assure proper authorizations are in place commensurate with job functions. The form used to conduct account review is &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/a/Innovation Force.io/forms/d/1oeejMta4XLiUsdH2gTKQ-glec6DBiwPJoY9F60HmPWk/viewform&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any Innovation Force workforce member can request change of access using this &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/a/Innovation Force.io/forms/d/1ySICzCyEEdNqxHHErjlJqREBijwxs9z72L-rWXrxkm0/viewform&#34;&gt;form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to systems is controlled using centralized user management and authentication. All authentication requests utilize two factor authentication using mobile devices as the second factor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temporary accounts are not used unless absolutely necessary for business purposes.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accounts are reviewed every 90 days to assure temporary accounts are not left unnecessarily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accounts that are inactive for over 90 days are removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of non-personal information, such as generic educational content, identification and authentication may not be required. This is the responsibility of Innovation Force Customers to define, and not Innovation Force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privileged users must first access systems using standard, unique user accounts before switching to privileged users and performing privileged tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All application to application communication using service accounts is restricted and not permitted unless absolutely needed. Automated tools are used to limit account access across applications and systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generic accounts are not allowed on Innovation Force systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access is granted through encrypted, VPN tunnels.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VPN utilizes AES 256 bit encryption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In cases of increased risk or known attempted unauthorized access, immediate steps are taken by the Security and Privacy Officer to limit access and reduce risk of unauthorized access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct system to system, system to application, and application to application authentication and authorization are limited and controlled to restrict access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;workforce-clearance-procedures:fee7af67ddba58b11ccceda5b79ee9ee&#34;&gt;Workforce Clearance Procedures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The level of security assigned to a user to the organization’s information systems is based on the minimum necessary amount of data access required to carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user’s job classification and/or to a user needing access to carry out treatment, payment, or healthcare operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All access requests are treated on a ‘least-access principle”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation Force maintains a minimum necessary approach to access to Customer data. As such, Innovation Force, including all workforce members, does not readily have access to any ePHI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;access-authorization:fee7af67ddba58b11ccceda5b79ee9ee&#34;&gt;Access Authorization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Role based access categories for each Innovation Force system and application are pre-approved by the Security Officer or VP of Engineering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation Force utilizes hardware and software firewalls to segment data, prevent unauthorized access, and monitor traffic for denial of service attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;person-or-entity-authentication:fee7af67ddba58b11ccceda5b79ee9ee&#34;&gt;Person or Entity Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each workforce member has and uses a unique user ID and password that identifies him/her as the user of the information system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each Customer and Partner has and uses a unique user ID and password that identifies him/her as the user of the information system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;unique-user-identification:fee7af67ddba58b11ccceda5b79ee9ee&#34;&gt;Unique User Identification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to the Innovation Force Platform systems and applications is controlled by requiring unique User Login ID’s and passwords for each individual user and developer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passwords requirements mandate strong password controls (see below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passwords are not displayed at any time and are not transmitted or stored in plain text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default accounts on all production systems, including root, are disabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared accounts are not allowed within Innovation Force systems or networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;automatic-logoff:fee7af67ddba58b11ccceda5b79ee9ee&#34;&gt;Automatic Logoff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users are required to make information systems inaccessible by any other individual when unattended by the users (ex. by using a password protected screen saver or logging off the system).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information systems automatically log users off the systems after 10 minutes of inactivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Security Officer pre-approves exceptions to automatic log off requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;employee-workstation-use:fee7af67ddba58b11ccceda5b79ee9ee&#34;&gt;Employee Workstation Use&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All workstations at Innovation Force are company owned, and all are laptop Apple products running Mac operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workstations may not be used to engage in any activity that is illegal or is in violation of organization’s policies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access may not be used for transmitting, retrieving, or storage of any communications of a discriminatory or harassing nature or materials that are obscene or “X-rated”. Harassment of any kind is prohibited. No messages with derogatory or inflammatory remarks about an individual’s race, age, disability, religion, national origin, physical attributes, sexual preference, or health condition shall be transmitted or maintained. No abusive, hostile, profane, or offensive language is to be transmitted through organization’s system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information systems/applications also may not be used for any other purpose that is illegal, unethical, or against company policies or contrary to organization’s best interests. Messages containing information related to a lawsuit or investigation may not be sent without prior approval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solicitation of non-company business, or any use of organization’s information systems/applications for personal gain is prohibited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transmitted messages may not contain material that criticizes organization, its providers, its employees, or others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users may not misrepresent, obscure, suppress, or replace another user’s identity in transmitted or stored messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workstation hard drives will be encrypted using FileVault 2.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All workstations have firewalls enabled to prevent unauthorized access unless explicitly granted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All workstations are to have the following messages added to the lock screen and login screen: &lt;em&gt;This computer is owned by Innovation Force, Inc. By logging in, unlocking, and/or using this computer you acknowledge you have seen, and follow, these policies (&lt;a href=&#34;https://Innovation&#34;&gt;https://Innovation&lt;/a&gt; Force.io/policy/) and have completed this training (&lt;a href=&#34;https://training.Innovation&#34;&gt;https://training.Innovation&lt;/a&gt; Force.io/). Please contact us if you have problems with this - privacy@Innovation Force.io.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wireless-access-use:fee7af67ddba58b11ccceda5b79ee9ee&#34;&gt;Wireless Access Use&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation Force production systems are not accessible directly over wireless channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wireless access disabled on all production systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When access production systems via remote wireless connections, the same system access policies and procedures apply to wireless as all other connections, including wired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wireless networks managed within Innovation Force non-production facilities (offices, etc) are secured with the following configurations:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All data in transit over wireless is encrypted using WPA2 encryption;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSIDs are not broadcast;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passwords are rotated on a regular basis, presently quarterly. This process is managed by the Innovation Force Security Officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;employee-termination-procedures:fee7af67ddba58b11ccceda5b79ee9ee&#34;&gt;Employee Termination Procedures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Human Resources Department (or other designated department), users, and their supervisors are required to notify the Security Officer upon completion and/or termination of access needs and facilitating completion of the “Termination Checklist&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Human Resources Department, users, and supervisors are required to notify the IS Help Desk to terminate a user’s access rights if there is evidence or reason to believe the following (these incidents are also reported on an incident report and is filed with the Privacy Officer):

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user has been using their access rights inappropriately;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A user’s password has been compromised (a new password may be provided to the user if the user is not identified as the individual compromising the original password);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An unauthorized individual is utilizing a user’s User Login ID and password (a new password may be provided to the user if the user is not identified as providing the unauthorized individual with the User Login ID and password).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Security Officer will terminate users’ access rights immediately upon notification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Security Officer audits and may terminate access of users that have not logged into organization’s information systems/applications for an extended period of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;paper-records:fee7af67ddba58b11ccceda5b79ee9ee&#34;&gt;Paper Records&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation Force does not use paper records for any sensitive information. Use of paper for recording and storing sensitive data is against Innovation Force policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;password-management:fee7af67ddba58b11ccceda5b79ee9ee&#34;&gt;Password Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User IDs and passwords are used to control access to Innovation Force systems and may not be disclosed to anyone for any reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users may not allow anyone, for any reason, to have access to any information system using another user’s unique user ID and password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On all production systems and application in the Innovation Force environment, password configurations are set to require that passwords are a minimum of 8 character length, 90 day password expiration, account lockout after 5 invalid attempts, password history of last 4 passwords remembered, and account lockout after 15 minutes of inactivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All system and application passwords are hashed by concatenating the user&amp;rsquo;s password and a random 256-bit salt value, generated on a per-user basis, and then applying SHA-256 to the value to create a password hash. The password hash and the salt are then stored in the backend database and are used for password validation on future user authentication attempts.* Each information system automatically requires users to change passwords at a pre-determined interval as determined by the organization, based on the criticality and sensitivity of the ePHI contained within the network, system, application, and/or database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passwords are inactivated immediately upon an employee’s termination (refer to the termination procedures in this policy).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All default system, application, and Partner passwords are changed before deployment to production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All passwords used in configuration scripts are secured and encrypted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a user believes their user ID has been compromised, they are required to immediately report the incident to the Security Office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;paas-customer-access-to-systems:fee7af67ddba58b11ccceda5b79ee9ee&#34;&gt;PaaS Customer Access to Systems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation Force grants PaaS customer secure system access via VPN connections. This access is only to Customer-specific systems, no other systems in the environment. These connections are setup at customer deployment. These connections are secured and encrypted and the only method for customers to connect to Innovation Force hosted systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of data migration, Innovation Force does, on a case by case basis, support customers in importing data. In these cases Innovation Force support SCP assuring all data is secured and encrypted in transit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of an investigation, Innovation Force will assist customers, at Innovation Force&amp;rsquo;s discretion, and law enforcement in forensics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;security-officer:13ec93c0f216267d52e2ad4d1f250955&#34;&gt;Security Officer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Security Officer is responsible for facilitating the training and supervision of all workforce members [164.308(a)(3)(ii)(A) and 164.308(a)(5)(ii)(A)], investigation and sanctioning of any workforce member that is in violation of Innovation Force security policies and non-compliance with the security regulations [164.308(a)(1)(ii)&amp;copy;], and writing, implementing, and maintaining all polices, procedures, and documentation related to efforts toward security and compliance [164.316(a-b)].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current Innovation Force Security Officer is Adam Leko (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:adam@Innovation Force.io&#34;&gt;adam@Innovation Force.io&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;organizational-responsibilities:13ec93c0f216267d52e2ad4d1f250955&#34;&gt;Organizational Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Security Officer, in collaboration with the Privacy Officer, is responsible for facilitating the development, implementation, and oversight of all activities pertaining to Innovation Force’s efforts to be compliant with the HIPAA Security Regulations, HITRUST CSF, and any other security and compliance frameworks.  The intent of the Security Officer Responsibilities is to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI.  These organizational responsibilities include, but are not limited to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oversees and enforces all activities necessary to maintain compliance and verifies the activities are in alignment with the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helps to established and maintain written policies and procedures to comply with the Security rule and maintains them for six years from the date of creation or date it was last in effect, whichever is later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updates policies and procedures as necessary and appropriate to maintain compliance and maintains changes made for six years from the date of creation or date it was last in effect, whichever is later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facilitates audits to validate compliance efforts throughout the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documents all activities and assessments completed to maintain compliance and maintains documentation for six years from the date of creation or date it was last in effect, whichever is later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provides copies of the policies and procedures to management, customers, and partners, and has them available to review by all other workforce members to which they apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annually, and as necessary, reviews and updates documentation to respond to environmental or operational changes affecting the security and risk posture of ePHI stored, transmitted, or processed within Innovation Force infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Develops and provides periodic security updates and reminder communications for all workforce members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implements procedures for the authorization and/or supervision of workforce members who work with ePHI or in locations where it may be accessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintains a program promoting workforce members to report non-compliance with policies and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promptly, properly, and consistently investigates and addresses reported violations and takes steps to prevent recurrence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applies consistent and appropriate sanctions against workforce members who fail to comply with the security policies and procedures of Innovation Force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mitigates, to the extent practicable, any harmful effect known to Innovation Force of a use or disclosure of ePHI in violation of Innovation Force’s policies and procedures, even if effect is the result of actions of Innovation Force business associates, customers, and/or partners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports security efforts and incidents to administration immediately upon discovery. Responsibilities in the case of a known ePHI breach are documented in the &lt;a href=&#34;./#breach&#34;&gt;Innovation Force Breach Policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Security Officer facilitates the communication of security updates and reminders to all workforce members to which it pertains.  Examples of security updates and reminders include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latest malicious software or virus alerts;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation Force’s requirement to report unauthorized attempts to access ePHI;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes in creating or changing passwords;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional security-focused training is provided to all workforce members by the Security Officer.  This training includes, but is not limited to:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data backup plans;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System auditing procedures;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redundancy procedures;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contingency plans;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virus protection;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patch management;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Media Disposal and/or Re-use;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;supervision-of-workforce-responsibilities:13ec93c0f216267d52e2ad4d1f250955&#34;&gt;Supervision of Workforce Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Security Officer is responsible for implementing and overseeing all activities related to maintaining compliance, it is the responsibility of all workforce members (i.e. team leaders, supervisors, managers, directors, co-workers, etc.) to supervise all workforce members and any other user of Innovation Force’s systems, applications, servers, workstations, etc. that contain ePHI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitor workstations and applications for unauthorized use, tampering, and theft and report non-compliance according to the Security Incident Response policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assist the Security and Privacy Officers to ensure appropriate role-based access is provided to all users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take all reasonable steps to hire, retain, and promote workforce members and provide access to users who comply with the Security regulation and Innovation Force’s security policies and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sanctions-of-workforce-responsibilities:13ec93c0f216267d52e2ad4d1f250955&#34;&gt;Sanctions of Workforce Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All workforce members report non-compliance of Innovation Force’s policies and procedures to the Security Officer or other individual as assigned by the Security Officer.  Individuals that report violations in good faith may not be subjected to intimidation, threats, coercion, discrimination against, or any other retaliatory action as a consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Security Officer promptly facilitates a thorough investigation of all reported violations of Innovation Force’s security policies and procedures.  The Security Officer may request the assistance from others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete an audit trail/log to identify and verify the violation and sequence of events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interview any individual that may be aware of or involved in the incident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All individuals are required to cooperate with the investigation process and provide factual information to those conducting the investigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide individuals suspected of non-compliance of the Security rule and/or Innovation Force’s policies and procedures the opportunity to explain their actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The investigators thoroughly documents the investigation as the investigation occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Violation of any security policy or procedure by workforce members may result in corrective disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.  Violation of this policy and procedures by others, including business associates, customers, and partners may result in termination of the relationship and/or associated privileges.  Violation may also result in civil and criminal penalties as determined by federal and state laws and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A violation resulting in a breach of confidentiality (i.e. release of PHI to an unauthorized individual), change of the integrity of any ePHI, or inability to access any ePHI by other users, requires immediate termination of the workforce member from Innovation Force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Security Officer facilitates taking appropriate steps to prevent recurrence of the violation (when possible and feasible).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of an insider threat, the Security Officer and Privacy Officer are to setup a team to investigate and mitigate the risk of insider malicious activity. Innovation Force workforce members are encouraged to come forward with information about insider threats, and can do so anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Security Officer maintains all documentation of the investigation, sanctions provided, and actions taken to prevent reoccurrence for a minimum of six years after the conclusion of the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Risk Management Policy</title>
      <link>http://innovation-force.github.io/hipaa_docs/policy/risk_management_policy/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2016 08:37:57 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://innovation-force.github.io/hipaa_docs/policy/risk_management_policy/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This policy establishes the scope, objectives, and procedures of Innovation Force&amp;rsquo;s information security risk management process. The risk management process is intended to support and protect the organization and its ability to fulfill its mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applicable-standards-from-the-hitrust-common-security-framework:bc6683bf874222d7fe17469168297da4&#34;&gt;Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;03.a - Risk Management Program Development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;03.b - Performing Risk Assessments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;03.c - Risk Mitigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applicable-standards-from-the-hipaa-security-rule:bc6683bf874222d7fe17469168297da4&#34;&gt;Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) – HIPAA Security Rule Risk Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B) – HIPAA Security Rule Risk Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;164.308(a)(8) – HIPAA Security Rule Evaluation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;risk-management-policies:bc6683bf874222d7fe17469168297da4&#34;&gt;Risk Management Policies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is the policy of Innovation Force to conduct thorough and timely risk assessments of the potential threats and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI) (and other confidential and proprietary electronic information) it stores, transmits, and/or processes for its Customers and to develop strategies to efficiently and effectively mitigate the risks identified in the assessment process as an integral part of the Innovation Force&amp;rsquo;s information security program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk analysis and risk management are recognized as important components of Innovation Force’s corporate compliance program and information security program in accordance with the Risk Analysis and Risk Management implementation specifications within the Security Management standard and the evaluation standards set forth in the HIPAA Security Rule, 45 CFR 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A), 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B), 164.308(a)(1)(i), and 164.308(a)(8).

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk assessments are done throughout product life cycles:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the integration of new system technologies and before changes are made to Innovation Force physical safeguards; and

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These changes do not include routine updates to existing systems, deployments of new systems created based on previously configured systems, deployments of new Customers, or new code developed for operations and management of the Innovation Force Platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While making changes to Innovation Force physical equipment and facilities that introduce new, untested configurations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation Force performs periodic technical and non-technical assessments of the security rule requirements as well as in response to environmental or operational changes affecting the security of ePHI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation Force implements security measures sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all ePHI Innovation Force receives, maintains, processes, and/or transmits for its Customers;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of Customer ePHI;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect against any reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of Customer ePHI that are not permitted or required; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure compliance by all workforce members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any risk remaining (residual) after other risk controls have been applied, requires sign off by the senior management and Innovation Force’s Security Officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All Innovation Force workforce members are expected to fully cooperate with all persons charged with doing risk management work, including contractors and audit personnel. Any workforce member that violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary action based on the severity of the violation, as outlined in the Innovation Force Roles Policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The implementation, execution, and maintenance of the information security risk analysis and risk management process is the responsibility of Innovation Force’s Security Officer (or other designated employee), and the identified Risk Management Team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All risk management efforts, including decisions made on what controls to put in place as well as those to not put into place, are documented and the documentation is maintained for six years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;risk-management-procedures:bc6683bf874222d7fe17469168297da4&#34;&gt;Risk Management Procedures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;: The intent of completing a risk assessment is to determine potential threats and vulnerabilities and the likelihood and impact should they occur. The output of this process helps to identify appropriate controls for reducing or eliminating risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 1. System Characterization&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first step in assessing risk is to define the scope of the effort. To do this, identify where ePHI is received, maintained, processed, or transmitted. Using information-gathering techniques, the Innovation Force Platform boundaries are identified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output – Characterization of the Innovation Force Platform system assessed, a good picture of the Platform environment, and delineation of Platform boundaries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 2. Threat Identification&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential threats (the potential for threat-sources to successfully exercise a particular vulnerability) are identified and documented. All potential threat-sources through the review of historical incidents and data from intelligence agencies, the government, etc., to help generate a list of potential threats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output – A threat list containing a list of threat-sources that could exploit Platform vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 3. Vulnerability Identification&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a list of technical and non-technical Platform vulnerabilities that could be exploited or triggered by potential threat-sources. Vulnerabilities can range from incomplete or conflicting policies that govern an organization’s computer usage to insufficient safeguards to protect facilities that house computer equipment to any number of software, hardware, or other deficiencies that comprise an organization’s computer network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output – A list of the Platform vulnerabilities (observations) that could be exercised by potential threat-sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 4. Control Analysis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document and assess the effectiveness of technical and non-technical controls that have been or will be implemented by Innovation Force to minimize or eliminate the likelihood / probability of a threat-source exploiting a Platform vulnerability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output – List of current or planned controls (policies, procedures, training, technical mechanisms, insurance, etc.) used for the Platform to mitigate the likelihood of a vulnerability being exercised and reduce the impact of such an adverse event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 5. Likelihood Determination&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the overall likelihood rating that indicates the probability that a vulnerability could be exploited by a threat-source given the existing or planned security controls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output – Likelihood rating of low (.1), medium (.5), or high (1). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 6. Impact Analysis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the level of adverse impact that would result from a threat successfully exploiting a vulnerability. Factors of the data and systems to consider should include the importance to Innovation Force&amp;rsquo;s mission; sensitivity and criticality (value or importance); costs associated; loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output – Magnitude of impact rating of low (10), medium (50), or high (100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 7. Risk Determination&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a risk level. By multiplying the ratings from the likelihood determination and impact analysis, a risk level is determined. This represents the degree or level of risk to which an IT system, facility, or procedure might be exposed if a given vulnerability were exercised. The risk rating also presents actions that senior management must take for each risk level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output – Risk level of low (1-10), medium (&amp;gt;10-50) or high (&amp;gt;50-100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 8. Control Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify controls that could reduce or eliminate the identified risks, as appropriate to the organization’s operations to an acceptable level. Factors to consider when developing controls may include effectiveness of recommended options (i.e., system compatibility), legislation and regulation, organizational policy, operational impact, and safety and reliability. Control recommendations provide input to the risk mitigation process, during which the recommended procedural and technical security controls are evaluated, prioritized, and implemented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output – Recommendation of control(s) and alternative solutions to mitigate risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 9. Results Documentation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results of the risk assessment are documented in an official report, spreadsheet, or briefing and provided to senior management to make decisions on policy, procedure, budget, and Platform operational and management changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output – A risk assessment report that describes the threats and vulnerabilities, measures the risk, and provides recommendations for control implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Mitigation&lt;/strong&gt;: Risk mitigation involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the Risk Assessment process to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Innovation Force Platform ePHI. Determination of appropriate controls to reduce risk is dependent upon the risk tolerance of the organization consistent with its goals and mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 1. Prioritize Actions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using results from Step 7 of the Risk Assessment, sort the threat and vulnerability pairs according to their risk-levels in descending order. This establishes a prioritized list of actions needing to be taken, with the pairs at the top of the list getting/requiring the most immediate attention and top priority in allocating resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output – Actions ranked from high to low&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 2. Evaluate Recommended Control Options&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although possible controls for each threat and vulnerability pair are arrived at in Step 8 of the Risk Assessment, review the recommended control(s) and alternative solutions for reasonableness and appropriateness. The feasibility (e.g., compatibility, user acceptance, etc.) and effectiveness (e.g., degree of protection and level of risk mitigation) of the recommended controls should be analyzed. In the end, select a “most appropriate” control option for each threat and vulnerability pair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output – list of feasible controls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 3. Conduct Cost-Benefit Analysis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the extent to which a control is cost-effective. Compare the benefit (e.g., risk reduction) of applying a control with its subsequent cost of application. Controls that are not cost-effective are also identified during this step. Analyzing each control or set of controls in this manner, and prioritizing across all controls being considered, can greatly aid in the decision-making process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output – Documented cost-benefit analysis of either implementing or not implementing each specific control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 4. Select Control(s)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking into account the information and results from previous steps, Innovation Force’s mission, and other important criteria, the Risk Management Team determines the best control(s) for reducing risks to the information systems and to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. These controls may consist of a mix of administrative, physical, and/or technical safeguards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output – Selected control(s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 5. Assign Responsibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the workforce members with the skills necessary to implement each of the specific controls outlined in the previous step, and assign their responsibilities. Also identify the equipment, training and other resources needed for the successful implementation of controls. Resources may include time, money, equipment, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output – List of resources, responsible persons and their assignments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 6. Develop Safeguard Implementation Plan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop an overall implementation or action plan and individual project plans needed to implement the safeguards and controls identified. The Implementation Plan should contain the following information:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each risk or vulnerability/threat pair and risk level;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritized actions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The recommended feasible control(s) for each identified risk;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required resources for implementation of selected controls;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team member responsible for implementation of each control;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start date for implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Target date for completion of implementation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintenance requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The overall implementation plan provides a broad overview of the safeguard implementation, identifying important milestones and timeframes, resource requirements (staff and other individuals’ time, budget, etc.), interrelationships between projects, and any other relevant information. Regular status reporting of the plan, along with key metrics and success indicators should be reported to Innovation Force Senior Management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual project plans for safeguard implementation may be developed and contain detailed steps that resources assigned carry out to meet implementation timeframes and expectations. Additionally, consider including items in individual project plans such as a project scope, a list deliverables, key assumptions, objectives, task completion dates and project requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output – Safeguard Implementation Plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 7. Implement Selected Controls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As controls are implemented, monitor the affected system(s) to verify that the implemented controls continue to meet expectations. Elimination of all risk is not practical. Depending on individual situations, implemented controls may lower a risk level but not completely eliminate the risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continually and consistently communicate expectations to all Risk Management Team members, as well as senior management and other key people throughout the risk mitigation process. Identify when new risks are identified and when controls lower or offset risk rather than eliminate it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional monitoring is especially crucial during times of major environmental changes, organizational or process changes, or major facilities changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If risk reduction expectations are not met, then repeat all or a part of the risk management process so that additional controls needed to lower risk to an acceptable level can be identified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output – Residual Risk documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Management Schedule&lt;/strong&gt;: The two principle components of the risk management process - risk assessment and risk mitigation - will be carried out according to the following schedule to ensure the continued adequacy and continuous improvement of Innovation Force’s information security program:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scheduled Basis – an overall risk assessment of Innovation Force’s information system infrastructure will be conducted annually. The assessment process should be completed in a timely fashion so that risk mitigation strategies can be determined and included in the corporate budgeting process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throughout a System’s Development Life Cycle – from the time that a need for a new, untested information system configuration and/or application is identified through the time it is disposed of, ongoing assessments of the potential threats to a system and its vulnerabilities should be undertaken as a part of the maintenance of the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Needed – the Security Officer (or other designated employee) or Risk Management Team may call for a full or partial risk assessment in response to changes in business strategies, information technology, information sensitivity, threats, legal liabilities, or other significant factors that affect Innovation Force’s Platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;process-documentation:bc6683bf874222d7fe17469168297da4&#34;&gt;Process Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintain documentation of all risk assessment, risk management, and risk mitigation efforts for a minimum of six years.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Innovation Force implements policies and procedures to maintain compliance and integrity of data. The Security Officer and Privacy Officer are responsible for maintaining policies and procedures and assuring all Innovation Force workforce members, business associates, customers, and partners are adherent to all applicable policies. Previous versions of policies are retained to assure ease of finding policies at specific historic dates in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applicable-standards-from-the-hitrust-common-security-framework:40d904a16cbade4b8946f6d93ae70469&#34;&gt;Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12.c - Developing and Implementing Continuity Plans Including Information Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applicable-standards-from-the-hipaa-security-rule:40d904a16cbade4b8946f6d93ae70469&#34;&gt;Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;164.316(a) - Policies and Procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;164.316(b)(1)(i) - Documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;maintenance-of-policies:40d904a16cbade4b8946f6d93ae70469&#34;&gt;Maintenance of Policies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All policies are stored and up to date to maintain Innovation Force compliance with HIPAA, HITRUST, NIST, and other relevant standards. Updates and version control is done similar to source code control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Policy update requests can be made by any workforce member at any time. Furthermore, all policies are reviewed annually by both the Security and Privacy Officer to assure accurate and up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edits and updates made by appropriate and authorized workforce members are done on their own versions, or branches. These changes are only merged back into final, or master, versions by the Privacy or Security Officer, similarly to a pull request. All changes are linked to workforce personnel who made them and the Officer who accepted them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All policies are made accessible to all Innovation Force workforce members. The current master policies are published &lt;a href=&#34;https://Innovation Force.io/policy/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes can be requested to policies using this &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/a/Innovation Force.io/forms/d/1sJ_8DcbbW8i2i85pqXU7JrjHLFYBhFj_TP5uAG4QFZE/viewform&#34;&gt;form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the change has been approved to a Innovation Force Policy we implement the policy change using Salt. The process for that is spelled out in the Innovation Force Configuration Management Policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes are automatically communicated to all Innovation Force team members through integrations between Github and Slack that log all Github policy channels to a dedicated Innovation Force Slack Channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All policies, and associated documentation, are retained for 6 years from the date of its creation or the date when it last was in effect, whichever is later

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version history of all Innovation Force policies is done via Github.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backup storage of all policies is done with Box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The policies and information security policies are reviewed and audited annually. Issues that come up as part of this process are reviewed by Innovation Force management to assure all risks and potential gaps are mitigated and/or fully addressed. The policy review form can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/a/Innovation Force.io/forms/d/1kuyIYA-Z-tmRdfMwrVMl59BujIy9y1dyjMSd8_Wy760/viewform&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation Force utilizes the HITRUST MyCSF framework to track compliance with the HITRUST CSF on an annual basis. Innovation Force also tracks compliance with HIPAA and publishes results &lt;a href=&#34;https://Innovation Force.io/hipaa/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional documentation related to maintenance of policies is outlined in the Security officers responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Application&lt;/em&gt;: An application hosted by Innovation Force, either maintained and created by Innovation Force, or maintained and created by a Customer or Partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Application Level&lt;/em&gt;: Controls and security associated with an Application. In the case of PaaS Customers, Innovation Force does not have access to and cannot assure compliance with security standards and policies at the Application Level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audit&lt;/em&gt;: Internal process of reviewing information system access and activity (e.g., log-ins, file accesses, and security incidents). An audit may be done as a periodic event, as a result of a patient complaint, or suspicion of employee wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audit Controls&lt;/em&gt;: Technical mechanisms that track and record computer/system activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audit Logs&lt;/em&gt;: Encrypted records of activity maintained by the system which provide: 1) date and time of activity; 2) origin of activity (app); 3) identification of user doing activity; and 4) data accessed as part of activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Access&lt;/em&gt;: Means the ability or the means necessary to read, write, modify, or communicate data/ information or otherwise use any system resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breach&lt;/em&gt;: Means the acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of protected health information (PHI) in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule which compromises the security or privacy of the PHI. For purpose of this definition, “compromises the security or privacy of the PHI” means poses a significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to the individual. A use or disclosure of PHI that does not include the identifiers listed at §164.514(e)(2), limited data set, date of birth, and zip code does not compromise the security or privacy of the PHI. Breach excludes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any unintentional acquisition, access or use of PHI by a workforce member or person acting under the authority of a Covered Entity (CE) or Business Associate (BA) if such acquisition, access, or use was made in good faith and within the scope of authority and does not result in further use or disclosure in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any inadvertent disclosure by a person who is authorized to access PHI at a CE or BA to another person authorized to access PHI at the same CE or BA, or organized health care arrangement in which the CE participates, and the information received as a result of such disclosure is not further used or disclosed in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A disclosure of PHI where a CE or BA has a good faith belief that an unauthorized person to whom the disclosure was made would not reasonably have been able to retain such information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Associate&lt;/em&gt;: A person or entity that performs certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on behalf of, or provides services to, a covered entity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;De-identification&lt;/em&gt;: The process of removing identifiable information so that data is rendered to not be PHI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disaster Recovery&lt;/em&gt;: The ability to recover a system and data after being made unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disaster Recovery Service&lt;/em&gt;: A disaster recovery service for disaster recovery in the case of system unavailability. This includes both the technical and the non-technical (process) required to effectively stand up an application after an outage. Offered with all Innovation Force Add-ons and as an option for PaaS Customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure&lt;/em&gt;: Disclosure means the release, transfer, provision of, access to, or divulging in any other manner of information outside the entity holding the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customers&lt;/em&gt;: Contractually bound users of Innovation Force Platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI)&lt;/em&gt;: Any individually identifiable health information protected by HIPAA that is transmitted by, processed in some way, or stored in electronic media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Environment&lt;/em&gt;: The overall technical environment, including all servers, network devices, and applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Event&lt;/em&gt;: An event is defined as an occurrence that does not constitute a serious adverse effect on Innovation Force, its operations, or its Customers, though it may be less than optimal. Examples of events include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hard drive malfunction that requires replacement;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systems become unavailable due to power outage that is non-hostile in nature, with redundancy to assure ongoing availability of data;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accidental lockout of an account due to incorrectly entering a password multiple times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Individually Identifiable Health Information&lt;/em&gt;: That information that is a subset of health information, including demographic information collected from an individual, and is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, employer, or health care clearinghouse; and relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual; the provision of health care to an individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual; and identifies the individual; or with respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe the information can be used to identify the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indication&lt;/em&gt;: A sign that an Incident may have occurred or may be occurring at the present time. Examples of indications include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The network intrusion detection sensor alerts when a known exploit occurs against an FTP server. Intrusion detection is generally reactive, looking only for footprints of known attacks. It is important to note that many IDS “hits” are also false positives and are neither an event nor an incident;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The antivirus software alerts when it detects that a host is infected with a worm;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users complain of slow access to hosts on the Internet;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The system administrator sees a filename with unusual characteristics;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated alerts of activity from log monitors like OSSEC;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An alert from OSSEC about file system integrity issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intrusion Detection System (IDS)&lt;/em&gt;: A software tool use to automatically detect and notify in the event of possible unauthorized network and/or system access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IDS Service&lt;/em&gt;: An Intrusion Detection Service for providing IDS notification to customers in the case of suspicious activity. Offered with all Innovation Force Add-ons and as an option for PaaS Customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logging Service&lt;/em&gt;: A logging service for unifying system and application logs, encrypting them, and providing a dashboard for them. Offered with all Innovation Force Add-ons and as an option for PaaS Customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Messaging&lt;/em&gt;: API-based services to deliver and receive SMS messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minimum Necessary Information&lt;/em&gt;: Protected health information that is the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the use, disclosure, or request. The “minimum necessary” standard applies to all protected health information in any form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Off-Site&lt;/em&gt;: For the purpose of storage of Backup media, off-site is defined as any location separate from the building in which the backup was created. It must be physically separate from the creating site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Organization&lt;/em&gt;: For the purposes of this policy, the term “organization” shall mean Innovation Force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Partner&lt;/em&gt;: Contractual bound 3rd party vendor with integration with the Innovation Force Platform. May offer Add-on services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platform&lt;/em&gt;: The overall technical environment of Innovation Force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protected Health Information (PHI)&lt;/em&gt;: Individually identifiable health information that is created by or received by the organization, including demographic information, that identifies an individual, or provides a reasonable basis to believe the information can be used to identify an individual, and relates to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Past, present or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The provision of health care to an individual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sanitization&lt;/em&gt;: Removal or the act of overwriting data to a point of preventing the recovery of the data on the device or media that is being sanitized. Sanitization is typically done before re-issuing a device or media, donating equipment that contained sensitive information or returning leased equipment to the lending company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trigger Event&lt;/em&gt;: Activities that may be indicative of a security breach that require further investigation (See Appendix).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Restricted Area&lt;/em&gt;: Those areas of the building(s) where protected health information and/or sensitive organizational information is stored, utilized, or accessible at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Role&lt;/em&gt;: The category or class of person or persons doing a type of job, defined by a set of similar or identical responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Precursor&lt;/em&gt;: A sign that an Incident may occur in the future. Examples of precursors include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suspicious network and host-based IDS events/attacks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alerts as a result of detecting malicious code at the network and host levels;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alerts from file integrity checking software;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audit log alerts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Risk&lt;/em&gt;: The likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability, and the impact of that event on the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of ePHI, other confidential or proprietary electronic information, and other system assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Risk Management Team&lt;/em&gt;: Individuals who are knowledgeable about the Organization’s HIPAA Privacy, Security and HITECH policies, procedures, training program, computer system set up, and technical security controls, and who are responsible for the risk management process and procedures outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Risk Assessment&lt;/em&gt;: (Referred to as Risk Analysis in the HIPAA Security Rule); the process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifies the risks to information system security and determines the probability of occurrence and the resulting impact for each threat/vulnerability pair identified given the security controls in place;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritizes risks; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results in recommended possible actions/controls that could reduce or offset the determined risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Risk Management&lt;/em&gt;: Within this policy, it refers to two major process components: risk assessment and risk mitigation. This differs from the HIPAA Security Rule, which defines it as a risk mitigation process only. The definition used in this policy is consistent with the one used in documents published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Risk Mitigation&lt;/em&gt;: Referred to as Risk Management in the HIPAA Security Rule, and is a process that prioritizes, evaluates, and implements security controls that will reduce or offset the risks determined in the risk assessment process to satisfactory levels within an organization given its mission and available resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Security Incident&lt;/em&gt; (or just Incident): A security incident is an occurrence that exercises a significant adverse effect on people, process, technology, or data. Security incidents include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A system or network breach accomplished by an internal or external entity; this breach can be inadvertent or malicious;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unauthorized disclosure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unauthorized change or destruction of ePHI (i.e. delete dictation, data alterations not following Innovation Force’s procedures);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Denial of service not attributable to identifiable physical, environmental, human or technology causes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disaster or enacted threat to business continuity;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Security Incident: A violation or imminent threat of violation of information security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. Examples of information security incidents may include, but are not limited to, the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Denial of Service: An attack that prevents or impairs the authorized use of networks, systems, or applications by exhausting resources;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Malicious Code: A virus, worm, Trojan horse, or other code-based malicious entity that infects a host;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unauthorized Access/System Hijacking: A person gains logical or physical access without permission to a network, system, application, data, or other resource. Hijacking occurs when an attacker takes control of network devices or workstations;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inappropriate Usage: A person violates acceptable computing use policies;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other examples of observable information security incidents may include, but are not limited to:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of another person’s individual password and/or account to login to a system;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure to protect passwords and/or access codes (e.g., posting passwords on equipment);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installation of unauthorized software;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminated workforce member accessing applications, systems, or network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Threat&lt;/em&gt;: The potential for a particular threat-source to successfully exercise a particular vulnerability. Threats are commonly categorized as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environmental – external fires, HVAC failure/temperature inadequacy, water pipe burst, power failure/fluctuation, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human – hackers, data entry, workforce/ex-workforce members, impersonation, insertion of malicious code, theft, viruses, SPAM, vandalism, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural – fires, floods, electrical storms, tornados, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technological – server failure, software failure, ancillary equipment failure, etc. and environmental threats, such as power outages, hazardous material spills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other – explosions, medical emergencies, misuse or resources, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Threat Source&lt;/em&gt;: Any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm (intentional or unintentional) to an IT system. Common threat sources can be natural, human or environmental which can impact the organization’s ability to protect ePHI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Threat Action&lt;/em&gt;: The method by which an attack might be carried out (e.g., hacking, system intrusion, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unrestricted Area&lt;/em&gt;: Those areas of the building(s) where protected health information and/or sensitive organizational information is not stored or is not utilized or is not accessible there on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unsecured Protected Health Information&lt;/em&gt;: Protected health information (PHI) that is not rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals through the use of technology or methodology specified by the Secretary in the guidance issued under section 13402(h)(2) of Pub. L.111-5 on the HHS website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electronic PHI has been encrypted as specified in the HIPAA Security rule by the use of an algorithmic process to transform data into a form in which there is a low probability of assigning meaning without the use of a confidential process or key and such confidential process or key that might enable decryption has not been breached. To avoid a breach of the confidential process or key, these decryption tools should be stored on a device or at a location separate from the data they are used to encrypt or decrypt. The following encryption processes meet this standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valid encryption processes for data at rest (i.e. data that resides in databases, file systems and other structured storage systems) are consistent with NIST Special Publication 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valid encryption processes for data in motion (i.e. data that is moving through a network, including wireless transmission) are those that comply, as appropriate, with NIST Special Publications 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations; 800-77, Guide to IPSec VPNs; or 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs, and may include others which are Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS 140-2 validated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The media on which the PHI is stored or recorded has been destroyed in the following ways:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paper, film, or other hard copy media have been shredded or destroyed such that the PHI cannot be read or otherwise cannot be reconstructed. Redaction is specifically excluded as a means of data destruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electronic media have been cleared, purged, or destroyed consistent with NIST Special Publications 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, such that the PHI cannot be retrieved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vendors&lt;/em&gt;: Persons from other organizations marketing or selling products or services, or providing services to Innovation Force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vulnerability&lt;/em&gt;: A weakness or flaw in an information system that can be accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited by a threat and lead to a compromise in the integrity of that system, i.e., resulting in a security breach or violation of policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workstation&lt;/em&gt;: An electronic computing device, such as a laptop or desktop computer, or any other device that performs similar functions, used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. Workstation devices may include, but are not limited to: laptop or desktop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), tablet PCs, and other handheld devices. For the purposes of this policy, “workstation” also includes the combination of hardware, operating system, application software, and network connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workforce&lt;/em&gt;: Means employees, volunteers, trainees, and other persons whose conduct, in the performance of work for a covered entity, is under the direct control of such entity, whether or not they are paid by the covered entity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Incident Response Policy</title>
      <link>http://innovation-force.github.io/hipaa_docs/policy/incident_response_policy/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Innovation Force implements an information security incident response process to consistently detect, respond, and report incidents, minimize loss and destruction, mitigate the weaknesses that were exploited, and restore information system functionality and business continuity as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident response process addresses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous monitoring of threats through intrusion detection systems (IDS) and other monitoring applications;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establishment of an information security incident response team;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establishment of procedures to respond to media inquiries;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establishment of clear procedures for identifying, responding, assessing, analyzing, and follow-up of information security incidents;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workforce training, education, and awareness on information security incidents and required responses; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitation of clear communication of information security incidents with internal, as well as external, stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applicable-standards-from-the-hitrust-common-security-framework:e716343bc6175d316e5f919fcdcba8bf&#34;&gt;Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11.a - Reporting Information Security Events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11.c - Responsibilities and Procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11.a - Reporting Information Security Events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applicable-standards-from-the-hipaa-security-rule:e716343bc6175d316e5f919fcdcba8bf&#34;&gt;Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;164.308(a)(5)(i) – Security Awareness and Training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;164.308(a)(6) – Security Incident Procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;incident-management-policies:e716343bc6175d316e5f919fcdcba8bf&#34;&gt;Incident Management Policies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Innovation Force incident response process follows the process recommended by SANS, an industry leader in security (www.sans.org). Process flows are a direct representation of the SANS process. Review Appendix 1 for a flowchart identifying each phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;identification-phase:e716343bc6175d316e5f919fcdcba8bf&#34;&gt;Identification Phase&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immediately upon observation Innovation Force members report suspected and known Precursors, Events, Indications, and Incidents in one of the following ways:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct report to management, the Security Officer, Privacy Officer, or other;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone call;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online incident response form located &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/a/Innovation Force.io/forms/d/1Hn4di9Jdw5JT8vISMh6tVUnh94VpeHucell7Ca4fKTo/viewform&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure Chat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymously through workforce members desired channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The individual receiving the report facilitates completion of an &lt;a href=&#34;./incident.form.pdf&#34;&gt;Incident Identification form&lt;/a&gt; and notifies the Security Officer (if not already done).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Security Officer determines if the issue is a Precursor, Event, Indication, or Incident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the issue is an event, indication, or precursor the Security Officer forwards it to the appropriate resource for resolution.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-Technical Event (minor infringement): the Security Officer completes a SIR Form (see Appendix 2) and investigates the incident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical Event: Assign the issue to an IT resource for resolution. This resource may also be a contractor or outsourced technical resource, in the event of a small office or lack of expertise in the area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the issue is a security incident the Security Officer activates the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) and notifies senior management.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a non-technical security incident is discovered the SIRT completes the investigation, implements preventative measures, and resolves the security incident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the investigation is completed, progress to Phase V, Follow-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the issue is a technical security incident, commence to Phase II: Containment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Containment, Eradication, and Recovery Phases are highly technical. It is important to have them completed by a highly qualified technical security resource with oversight by the SIRT team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each individual on the SIRT and the technical security resource document all measures taken during each phase, including the start and end times of all efforts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lead member of the SIRT team facilitates initiation of a Security Incident Report (SIR) Form (See Appendix 2 for sample format) or an Incident Survey Form (See Appendix 4).  The intent of the SIR form is to provide a summary of all events, efforts, and conclusions of each Phase of this policy and procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Security Officer, Privacy Officer, or Innovation Force representative appointed notifies any affected Customers and Partners. If no Customers and Partners are affected, notification is at the discretion of the Security and Privacy Officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of a threat identified, the Security Officer is to form a team to investigate and involve necessary resources, both internal to Innovation Force and potentially external.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;containment-phase-technical:e716343bc6175d316e5f919fcdcba8bf&#34;&gt;Containment Phase (Technical)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this Phase, Innovation Force’s IT department attempts to contain the security incident. It is extremely important to take detailed notes during the security incident response process. This provides that the evidence gathered during the security incident can be used successfully during prosecution, if appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SIRT reviews any information that has been collected by the Security Officer or any other individual investigating the security incident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SIRT secures the network perimeter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The IT department performs the following:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Securely connect to the affected system over a trusted connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retrieve any volatile data from the affected system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the relative integrity and the appropriateness of backing the system up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If appropriate, back up the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the password(s) to the affected system(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine whether it is safe to continue operations with the affect system(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is safe, allow the system to continue to function;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete any documentation relative to the security incident on the SIR Form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move to Phase V, Follow-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is NOT safe to allow the system to continue operations, discontinue the system(s) operation and move to Phase III, Eradication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The individual completing this phase provides written communication to the SIRT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuously apprise Senior Management of progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to notify affected Customers and Partners with relevant updates as needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;eradication-phase-technical:e716343bc6175d316e5f919fcdcba8bf&#34;&gt;Eradication Phase (Technical)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Eradication Phase represents the SIRT’s effort to remove the cause, and the resulting security exposures, that are now on the affected system(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine symptoms and cause related to the affected system(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen the defenses surrounding the affected system(s), where possible (a risk assessment may be needed and can be determined by the Security Officer). This may include the following:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An increase in network perimeter defenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An increase in system monitoring defenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remediation (“fixing”) any security issues within the affected system, such as removing unused services/general host hardening techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduct a detailed vulnerability assessment to verify all the holes/gaps that can be exploited have been addressed.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If additional issues or symptoms are identified, take appropriate preventative measures to eliminate or minimize potential future compromises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete the Eradication Form (see Appendix 4).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the documentation with the information learned from the vulnerability assessment, including the cause, symptoms, and the method used to fix the problem with the affected system(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apprise Senior Management of the progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to notify affected Customers and Partners with relevant updates as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move to Phase IV, Recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;recovery-phase-technical:e716343bc6175d316e5f919fcdcba8bf&#34;&gt;Recovery Phase (Technical)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Recovery Phase represents the SIRT’s effort to restore the affected system(s) back to operation after the resulting security exposures, if any, have been corrected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The technical team determines if the affected system(s) have been changed in any way.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they have, the technical team restores the system to its proper, intended functioning (“last known good”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once restored, the team validates that the system functions the way it was intended/had functioned in the past. This may require the involvement of the business unit that owns the affected system(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If operation of the system(s) had been interrupted (i.e., the system(s) had been taken offline or dropped from the network while triaged), restart the restored and validated system(s) and monitor for behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the system had not been changed in any way, but was taken offline (i.e., operations had been interrupted), restart the system and monitor for proper behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the documentation with the detail that was determined during this phase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apprise Senior Management of progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to notify affected Customers and Partners with relevant updates as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move to Phase V, Follow-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;follow-up-phase-technical-and-non-technical:e716343bc6175d316e5f919fcdcba8bf&#34;&gt;Follow-up Phase (Technical and Non-Technical)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Follow-up Phase represents the review of the security incident to look for “lessons learned” and to determine whether the process that was taken could have been improved in any way. It is recommended all security incidents be reviewed shortly after resolution to determine where response could be improved. Timeframes may extend to one to two weeks post-incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responders to the security incident (SIRT Team and technical security resource) meet to review the documentation collected during the security incident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a “lessons learned” document and attach it to the completed SIR Form.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluate the cost and impact of the security incident to Innovation Force using the documents provided by the SIRT and the technical security resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine what could be improved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate these findings to Senior Management for approval and for implementation of any recommendations made post-review of the security incident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carry out recommendations approved by Senior Management; sufficient budget, time and resources should be committed to this activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close the security incident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;periodic-evaluation:e716343bc6175d316e5f919fcdcba8bf&#34;&gt;Periodic Evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the processes surrounding security incident response should be periodically reviewed and evaluated for effectiveness. This also involves appropriate training of resources expected to respond to security incidents, as well as the training of the general population regarding the Innovation Force’s expectation for them, relative to security responsibilities. The incident response plan is tested annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;security-incident-response-team-sirt:e716343bc6175d316e5f919fcdcba8bf&#34;&gt;Security Incident Response Team (SIRT)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals needed and responsible to respond to a security incident make up a Security Incident Response Team (SIRT). Members may include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security Officer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy Officer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Senior Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VP of Engineering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>IDS Policy</title>
      <link>http://innovation-force.github.io/hipaa_docs/policy/ids_policy/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2016 08:20:19 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In order to preserve the integrity of data that Innovation Force stores, processes, or transmits for Customers, Innovation Force implements strong intrusion detection tools and policies to proactively track and retroactively investigate unauthorized access. Innovation Force currently utilizes &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ossec.net/&#34;&gt;OSSEC&lt;/a&gt; to track file system integrity, monitor log data, and detect rootkit access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applicable-standards-from-the-hitrust-common-security-framework:5e48a83f2533246e78bff741b198c8f2&#34;&gt;Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;09.ab - Monitoring System Use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;06.e - Prevention of Misuse of Information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10.h - Control of Operational Software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applicable-standards-from-the-hipaa-security-rule:5e48a83f2533246e78bff741b198c8f2&#34;&gt;Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;164.312(b) - Audit Controls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;intrusion-detection-policy:5e48a83f2533246e78bff741b198c8f2&#34;&gt;Intrusion Detection Policy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OSSEC is used to monitor and correlate log data from different systems on an ongoing basis. Reports generated by OSSEC are reviewed by the Security Officer on a monthly basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OSSEC generates alerts to analyze and investigate suspicious activity or suspected violations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OSSEC monitors file system integrity and sends real time alerts when suspicious changes are made to the file system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic monitoring is done to identify patterns that might signify the lack of availability of certain services and systems (DOS attacks).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation Force firewalls monitor all incoming traffic to detect potential denial of service attacks. Suspected attack sources are blocked automatically. Additionally, our hosting provider actively monitors its network to detect denial of services attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All new firewall rules and configuration changes are tested before being pushed into production. All firewall and router rules are reviewed every quarter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation Force utilizes redundant firewall on network perimeters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static IP addresses are used for Innovation Force servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Innovation Force works with Subcontractors to assure restriction of physical access to systems used as part of the Innovation Force Platform. Innovation Force and its Subcontractors control access to the physical buildings/facilities that house these systems/applications, or in which Innovation Force workforce members operate, in accordance to the HIPAA Security Rule 164.310 and its implementation specifications. Physical Access to all of Innovation Force facilities is limited to only those authorized in this policy. In an effort to safeguard ePHi from unauthorized access, tampering, and theft, access is allowed to areas only to those persons authorized to be in them and with escorts for unauthorized persons. All workforce members are responsible for reporting an incident of unauthorized visitor and/or unauthorized access to Innovation Force’s facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of note, Innovation Force does not have ready access to ePHI, it provides cloud-based, compliant infrastructure to covered entities and business associates. Innovation Force does not physically house any systems used by its Platform in Innovation Force facilities. Physical security of our Platform servers is outlined &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applicable-standards-from-the-hitrust-common-security-framework:a4e103fb29737534666ac267af8a9aac&#34;&gt;Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;08.b - Physical Entry Controls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;08.d - Protecting Against External and Environmental Threats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;08.j - Equipment Maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;08.l - Secure Disposal or Re-Use of Equipment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;09.p - Disposal of Media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovation-force-controlled-facility-access-policies:a4e103fb29737534666ac267af8a9aac&#34;&gt;Innovation Force-controlled Facility Access Policies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visitor and third party support access is recorded and supervised. All visitors are escorted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repairs are documented and the documentation is retained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire extinguishers and detectors are installed according to applicable laws and regulations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintenance is controlled and conducted by authorized personnel in accordance with supplier-recommended intervals, insurance policies and the organizations maintenance program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electronic and physical media containing covered information is securely destroyed (or the information securely removed) prior to disposal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The organization securely disposes media with sensitive information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical access is restricted using smart locks that track all access.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restricted areas and facilities are locked and when unattended (where feasible).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only authorized workforce members receive access to restricted areas (as determined by the Security Officer).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access and keys are revoked upon termination of workforce members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workforce members must report a lost and/or stolen key(s) to the Security Officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Security Officer facilitates the changing of the lock(s) within 7 days of a key being reported lost/stolen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforcement of Facility Access Policies

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report violations of this policy to the restricted area’s department team leader, supervisor, manager, or director, or the Privacy Officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workforce members in violation of this policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visitors in violation of this policy are subject to loss of vendor privileges and/or termination of services from Innovation Force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workstation Security

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workstations may only be accessed and utilized by authorized workforce members to complete assigned job/contract responsibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All workforce members are required to monitor workstations and report unauthorized users and/or unauthorized attempts to access systems/applications as per the System Access Policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All workstations purchased by Innovation Force are the property of Innovation Force and are distributed to users by the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;employment-policies:02d34b74b9da93e67cbdbebdb59dd9c1&#34;&gt;Employment Policies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All new workforce members, including contractors, are given training on security policies and procedures, including operations security, within 30 days of employment.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Records of training are kept for all workforce members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon completion of training, workforce members complete this &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/a/Innovation Force.io/forms/d/1bmEK3TidACj6ForBqGMaINPjIckv9ht28rtkGEQsBGs/viewform?usp=send_form&#34;&gt;form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ongoing security training is conducted monthly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current Innovation Force training is hosted &lt;a href=&#34;https://training.Innovation Force.io/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All workforce members are granted access to formal organizational policies, which include the sanction policy for security violations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Innovation Force Employee Handbook clearly states the responsibilities and acceptable behavior regarding information system usage, including rules for email, Internet, mobile devices and social media usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation Force does not allow mobile devices to conned to any of its production networks.&lt;/li&gt;

Training includes HIPAA reporting requirements, including the ability to anonymously report security incidents, and the levels of compliance and obligations for Innovation Force and its Customers and Partners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All remote (teleworking) workforce members are trained on the risks, the controls implemented, their responsibilities, and sanctions associated with violation of policies. Additionally, remote security is maintained through the use of VPN tunnels for all access to production systems with access to ePHI data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All Innovation Force-purchased and -owned computers are to display this message at login and when the computer is unlocked: &lt;em&gt;This computer is owned by Cambia Health Solutions. By logging in, unlocking, and/or using this computer you acknowledge whatever it is that security really says&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to internal Innovation Force systems can be requested using a System Access Request submitted through Remedy. All requests for access much be granted to the Innovation Force Security Officer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Request for modifications of access for any Innovation Force employee can be made using  this &lt;a href=&#34;no form yet&#34;&gt;form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Disposable Media Policy</title>
      <link>http://innovation-force.github.io/hipaa_docs/policy/disposable_media_policy/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2016 08:17:35 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://innovation-force.github.io/hipaa_docs/policy/disposable_media_policy/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Innovation Force recognizes that media containing ePHI may be reused when appropriate steps are taken to ensure that all stored ePHI has been effectively rendered inaccessible. Destruction/disposal of ePHI shall be carried out in accordance with federal and state law. The schedule for destruction/disposal shall be suspended for ePHI involved in any open investigation, audit, or litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation Force utilizes dedicated hardware from Subcontractors. ePHI is only stored on SSD volumes in our hosted environment. All SSD volumes utilized by Innovation Force and Innovation Force Customers are encrypted. Innovation Force does not use, own, or manage any mobile devices, SD cards, or tapes that have access to ePHI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applicable-standards-from-the-hitrust-common-security-framework:0c58a692a1bd150c21ea17178d10393d&#34;&gt;Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0.9o - Management of Removable Media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applicable-standards-from-the-hipaa-security-rule:0c58a692a1bd150c21ea17178d10393d&#34;&gt;Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;164.310(d)(1) - Device and Media Controls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;disposable-media-policy:0c58a692a1bd150c21ea17178d10393d&#34;&gt;Disposable Media Policy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All removable media is restricted, audited, and is encrypted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation Force assumes all disposable media in its Platform may contain ePHI, so it treats all disposable media with the same protections and disposal policies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All destruction/disposal of ePHI media will be done in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations and pursuant to the Innovation Force’s written retention policy/schedule. Records that have satisfied the period of retention will be destroyed/disposed of in an appropriate manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Records involved in any open investigation, audit or litigation should not be destroyed/disposed of. If notification is received that any of the above situations have occurred or there is the potential for such, the record retention schedule shall be suspended for these records until such time as the situation has been resolved. If the records have been requested in the course of a judicial or administrative hearing, a qualified protective order will be obtained to ensure that the records are returned to the organization or properly destroyed/disposed of by the requesting party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before reuse of any media, for example all ePHI is rendered inaccessible, cleaned, or scrubbed. All media is formatted to restrict future access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All Innovation Force Subcontractors provide that, upon termination of the contract, they will return or destroy/dispose of all patient health information. In cases where the return or destruction/disposal is not feasible, the contract limits the use and disclosure of the information to the purposes that prevent its return or destruction/disposal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any media containing ePHI is disposed using a method that ensures the ePHI could not be readily recovered or reconstructed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The methods of destruction, disposal, and reuse are reassessed periodically, based on current technology, accepted practices, and availability of timely and cost-effective destruction, disposal, and reuse technologies and services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the cases of a Innovation Force Customer terminating a contract with Innovation Force and not longer utilize Innovation Force Services, the following actions will be taken depending on the Innovation Force Services in use. In all cases it is solely the responsibility of the Innovation Force Customer to maintain the safeguards required of HIPAA once the data is transmitted out of Innovation Force Systems.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of BaaS Customer termination, Innovation Force will provide the customer with the ability to export data in commonly used format, currently CSV, for 30 days from the time of termination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of PaaS Customer termination, Innovation Force will provide the customer with 30 days from the date of termination to export data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Disaster Recovery Policy</title>
      <link>http://innovation-force.github.io/hipaa_docs/policy/disaster_recovery_policy/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2016 08:17:13 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://innovation-force.github.io/hipaa_docs/policy/disaster_recovery_policy/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The Innovation Force Contingency Plan establishes procedures to recover Innovation Force following a disruption resulting from a disaster. This Disaster Recovery Policy is maintained by the Innovation Force Security Officer and Privacy Officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following objectives have been established for this plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximize the effectiveness of contingency operations through an established plan that consists of the following phases:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notification/Activation phase&lt;/em&gt; to detect and assess damage and to activate the plan;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recovery phase&lt;/em&gt; to restore temporary IT operations and recover damage done to the original system;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reconstitution phase&lt;/em&gt; to restore IT system processing capabilities to normal operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the activities, resources, and procedures needed to carry out Innovation Force processing requirements during prolonged interruptions to normal operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify and define the impact of interruptions to Innovation Force systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assign responsibilities to designated personnel and provide guidance for recovering Innovation Force during prolonged periods of interruption to normal operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure coordination with other Innovation Force staff who will participate in the contingency planning strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure coordination with external points of contact and vendors who will participate in the contingency planning strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Innovation Force Contingency Plan has been developed as required under the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix III, November 2000, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Final Security Rule, Section §164.308(a)(7), which requires the establishment and implementation of procedures for responding to events that damage systems containing electronic protected health information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Innovation Force Contingency Plan is created under the legislative requirements set forth in the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and the guidelines established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-34, titled &amp;ldquo;Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems&amp;rdquo; dated June 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Innovation Force Contingency Plan also complies with the following federal and departmental policies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Computer Security Act of 1987;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix III, November 2000;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Federal Preparedness Circular (FPC) 65, Federal Executive Branch Continuity of Operations, July 1999;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 67, Enduring Constitutional Government and Continuity of Government Operations, OCAAber 1998;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PDD 63, Critical Infrastructure Protection, May 1998;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), The Federal Response Plan (FRP), April 1999;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 106-398), Title X, Subtitle G, “Government Information Security Reform,” OCAAber 30, 2000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of the types of disasters that would initiate this plan are natural disaster, political disturbances, man made disaster, external human threats, internal malicious activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation Force defined two categories of systems from a disaster recovery perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critical Systems&lt;/em&gt;. These systems host application servers and database servers or are required for functioning of systems that host application servers and database servers. These systems, if unavailable, affect the integrity of data and must be restored, or have a process begun to restore them, immediately upon becoming unavailable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Non-critical Systems&lt;/em&gt;. These are all systems not considered critical by definition above. These systems, while they may affect the performance and overall security of critical systems, do not prevent Critical systems from functioning and being accessed appropriately. These systems are restored at a lower priority than critical systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applicable-standards-from-the-hitrust-common-security-framework:cd0ee13adbcb599eb212ef03d5c15c12&#34;&gt;Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12.c - Developing and Implementing Continuity Plans Including Information Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applicable-standards-from-the-hipaa-security-rule:cd0ee13adbcb599eb212ef03d5c15c12&#34;&gt;Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;164.308(a)(7)(i) - Contingency Plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;line-of-succession:cd0ee13adbcb599eb212ef03d5c15c12&#34;&gt;Line of Succession&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following order of succession to ensure that decision-making authority for the Innovation Force Contingency Plan is uninterrupted. The Cloud Application Architect (CAA) and Security Officer, Alexander Thorpe, are responsible for ensuring the safety of personnel and the execution of procedures documented within this Innovation Force Contingency Plan. If the CAA and DireCAAr of Engineering are unable to function as the overall authority or chooses to delegate this responsibility to a successor, the Lead Developer shall function as that authority. To provide contact initiation should the contingency plan need to be initiated, please use the contact list below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ravi Vedanyagam, DireCAAr of Business Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alexander Thorpe, Cloud Application Architect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angelko Kristanavick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;responsibilities:cd0ee13adbcb599eb212ef03d5c15c12&#34;&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following teams have been developed and trained to respond to a contingency event affecting the IT system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Ops Team&lt;/strong&gt; is responsible for recovery of the Innovation Force hosted environment, network devices, and all servers. Members of the team include personnel who are also responsible for the daily operations and maintenance of Innovation Force. The team leader is the Director of Engineering and directs the Dev Ops Team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Web Services Team&lt;/strong&gt; is responsible for assuring all application servers, web services, and platform add-ons are working. It is also responsible for testing redeployments and assessing damage to the environment. The team leader is the CAA and directs the Web Services Team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;testing-and-maintenance:cd0ee13adbcb599eb212ef03d5c15c12&#34;&gt;Testing and Maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CAA and DireCAAr of Engineering shall establish criteria for validation/testing of a Contingency Plan, an annual test schedule, and ensure implementation of the test. This process will also serve as training for personnel involved in the plan’s execution. At a minimum the Contingency Plan shall be tested annually (within 365 days). The types of validation/testing exercises include tabletop and technical testing. Contingency Plans for all application systems must be tested at a minimum using the tabletop testing process. However, if the application system Contingency Plan is included in the technical testing of their respective support systems that technical test will satisfy the annual requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tabletop-testing:cd0ee13adbcb599eb212ef03d5c15c12&#34;&gt;Tabletop Testing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tabletop Testing is conducted in accordance with the the CMS Risk Management Handbook, Volume 2 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/Downloads/RMH_VII_4-5_Contingency_Plan_Exercise.pdf&#34;&gt;http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/Downloads/RMH_VII_4-5_Contingency_Plan_Exercise.pdf&lt;/a&gt;). The primary objective of the tabletop test is to ensure designated personnel are knowledgeable and capable of performing the notification/activation requirements and procedures as outlined in the CP, in a timely manner. The exercises include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing to validate the ability to respond to a crisis in a coordinated, timely, and effective manner, by simulating the occurrence of a specific crisis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;technical-testing:cd0ee13adbcb599eb212ef03d5c15c12&#34;&gt;Technical Testing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary objective of the technical test is to ensure the communication processes and data storage and recovery processes can function at an alternate site to perform the functions and capabilities of the system within the designated requirements. Technical testing shall include, but is not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process from backup system at the alternate site;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restore system using backups; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch compute and storage resources to alternate processing site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-notification-and-activation-phase:cd0ee13adbcb599eb212ef03d5c15c12&#34;&gt;1. Notification and Activation Phase&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phase addresses the initial actions taken to detect and assess damage inflicted by a disruption to Innovation Force. Based on the assessment of the Event, sometimes according to the Innovation Force Incident Response Policy, the Contingency Plan may be activated by either the CAA or Director of Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notification sequence is listed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first responder is to notify the CAA. All known information must be relayed to the CAA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Director of Engineering is to contact the Web Services Team and inform them of the event. The CAA is to to begin assessment procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CAA is to notify team members and direct them to complete the assessment procedures outlined below to determine the extent of damage and estimated recovery time. If damage assessment cannot be performed locally because of unsafe conditions, the CAA is to following the steps below.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Damage Assessment Procedures:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CAA and Director of Engineering are to logically assess damage, gain insight into whether the infrastructure is salvageable, and begin to formulate a plan for recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternate Assessment Procedures:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon notification from the CAA, the Director of Engineering is to follow the procedures for damage assessment with combined Dev Ops and Web Services Teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Innovation Force Contingency Plan is to be activated if one or more of the following criteria are met:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation Force will be unavailable for more than 48 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosting facility is damaged and will be unavailable for more than 24 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other criteria, as appropriate and as defined by Innovation Force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the plan is to be activated, the CAA is to notify and inform team members of the details of the event and if relocation is required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon notification from the CAA, group leaders and managers are to notify their respective teams. Team members are to be informed of all applicable information and prepared to respond and relocate if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CAA is to notify the hosting facility partners that a contingency event has been declared and to ship the necessary materials (as determined by damage assessment) to the alternate site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CAA is to notify remaining personnel and executive leadership on the general status of the incident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notification can be message, email, or phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-recovery-phase:cd0ee13adbcb599eb212ef03d5c15c12&#34;&gt;2. Recovery Phase&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section provides procedures for recovering the application at an alternate site, whereas other efforts are directed to repair damage to the original system and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following procedures are for recovering the Innovation Force infrastructure at the alternate site. Procedures are outlined per team required. Each procedure should be executed in the sequence it is presented to maintain efficient operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recovery Goal: The goal is to rebuild Innovation Force infrastructure to a production state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tasks outlines below are not sequential and some can be run in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact Partners and Customers affected - Web Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assess damage to the environment - Web Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin replication of new environment using automated and tested scrips, currently Salt. At this point it is determined whether to recover in AWS or in the Salt Lake Data center. - Dev Ops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test new environment using pre-written tests - Web Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test logging, security, and alerting functionality - Dev Ops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assure systems are appropriately patched and up to date. - Dev Ops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy environment to production - Web Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update DNS to new environment. - Dev Ops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-reconstitution-phase:cd0ee13adbcb599eb212ef03d5c15c12&#34;&gt;3. Reconstitution Phase&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section discusses activities necessary for restoring Innovation Force operations at the original or new site. The goal is to restore full operations within 24 hours of a disaster or outage. When the hosted data center at the original or new site has been restored, Innovation Force operations at the alternate site may be transitioned back. The goal is to provide a seamless transition of operations from the alternate site to the computer center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original or New Site Restoration&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin replication of new environment using automated and tested scrips, currently Salt. - Dev Ops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test new environment using pre-written tests. - Web Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test logging, security, and alerting functionality. - Dev Ops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy environment to production - Web Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assure systems are appropriately patched and up to date. - Dev Ops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update DNS to new environment. - Dev Ops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plan Deactivation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Innovation Force environment is moved back to the original site from the alternative site, all hardware used at the alternate site should be handled and disposed of according to the Innovation Force Media Disposal Policy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data Retention Policy</title>
      <link>http://innovation-force.github.io/hipaa_docs/policy/data_retention_policy/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Innovation Force understand and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Innovation Force is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Innovation Force has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Innovation Force Users to support data retention laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;state-medical-record-laws:cfde9d2fa6fd35593c32518f70dcd381&#34;&gt;State Medical Record Laws&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/appa7-1.pdf&#34;&gt;Listing of state requirements for medical record retention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-retention-policy:cfde9d2fa6fd35593c32518f70dcd381&#34;&gt;Data Retention Policy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current Innovation Force Users have data stored by Innovation Force as a part of the Innovation Force Service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once a User ceases to be a User, as defined below, the following steps are

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if User responds they do not want to reinstate account, User is sent directions for how to download their data from Innovation Force and/or to have Innovation Force continue to store the data at a rate of $25/month for up to 100GB. If there is more than 100GB of data, Innovation Force will work with User to determine storage costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If User downloads data or does not respond to notices from Innovation Force within 30 days, Innovation Force removed data from Innovation Force systems and User is sent notice of removal of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
