<li>Users may not allow anyone, for any reason, to have access to any information system using another user’s unique user ID and password.</li>

<li>All system and application passwords are hashed by concatenating the user&rsquo;s password and a random 256-bit salt value, generated on a per-user basis, and then applying SHA-256 to the value to create a password hash. The password hash and the salt are then stored in the backend database and are used for password validation on future user authentication attempts.* Each information system automatically requires users to change passwords at a pre-determined interval as determined by the organization, based on the criticality and sensitivity of the ePHI contained within the network, system, application, and/or database.</li>
<li>Passwords are inactivated immediately upon an employee’s termination (refer to the termination procedures in this policy).</li>
<li>All default system, application, and Partner passwords are changed before deployment to production.</li>
