<p>(see <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/securityrule/physsafeguards.pdf">164.310</a>)</p>

<p>This one is pretty straight forward - <em>physical measures, policies, and procedures to protect a covered entityâ€™s electronic information systems and related buildings and equipment, from natural and environmental hazards, and unauthorized intrusion.</em> Data center security is typically easier to address than office security, though at Innovation Force we address both.</p>

<pre><code>Innovation Force has a formal Workstation and Portable Media Security Policy that identifies the specific requirements of each device. The policies define the requirements for using and/or restricted specific actions while engaged with any ePHI. Additionally, workstations are secured appropriately to limit exposure to breaches. Firewalls and hard disk encryption are used on all workstations. Actions and events are monitored and controlled, with user restrictions on downloading or copying any ePHI without documented approval and business justification. Additionally, all file storage internally at Innovation Force utilizes HIPAA-compliant cloud-based vendors (currently Box and Google Apps).

</tbody>
</table>

<pre><code>Innovation Force has policies and procedures for all workstations that interact with and may potentially become exposed to ePHI. These policies have requirements for secure media disposal so that ePHI cannot be recovered from these systems.

Innovation Force has Media re-use requirements for the workstations, despite the fact that these workstations do not have access to and interaction with ePHI.

<p>This section of HIPAA outlines <em>the technology and the policy and procedures for its use that protect electronic protected health information and control access to it.</em> It is important to note that these requirements are not prescriptive, and there is flexibility in implementation. The key is that measures that are reasonable and appropriate are implemented to safeguard ePHI.</p>

Innovation Force has procedures and a process for obtaining access to ePHI should an emergency or disaster occur.

Innovation Force systems settings on all of its servers have session timeout features enabled and configured to terminate sessions after a period of 30 minutes or less.

Innovation Force encrypts all stored data in its environment using 256-bit AES encryption. Additionally, all data in transit is encrypted end to end (more below).
