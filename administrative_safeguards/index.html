<p>(see <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/index.html">164.314</a>)</p>

<p>Taken directly from the wording of the Security Rule, administrative safeguards are <em>administrative actions, and policies and procedures, to manage the selection, development, implementation, and maintenance of security measures to protect electronic protected health information and to manage the conduct of the covered entity&rsquo;s workforce in relation to the protection of that information.</em></p>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t specific security settings in this section, and the most important area covered is the risk assessment. The risk assessment is a fundamental process for any organization that wants to become compliant. Because Innovation Force is a division of Cambia Health Solutions some policy and compliance measures are shared with other departments of Cambia, such as the security office or disaster recovery.</p>

<pre><code>Innovation Force has a risk management policy that defines the risk analysis and risk management process. This policy is operationalized with processes to conduct regularly risk assessments. Innovation Force uses NIST800-30 and 800-26 for performing risk analysis. Our policy begins with an inventory of all Innovation Force systems, mapping of where ePHI is processed, transmitted, or stored, identification of threats, risks, and likelihood, and the mitigation of risks. Policies address risk inherent within the environment and mitigating the risk to an acceptable and reasonable level.

Innovation Force has a Sanction Policy that has sanctions for employees not adhering to certain policies, and for specifically violating HIPAA rules.

Policies and procedures address the requirements of monitoring and logging system level events and actions taken by individuals within the environment. All requests into and out of the Innovation Force network are logged, as well as all system events. Innovation Force, has implemented multiple logging and monitoring solutions to track events within their environment and to monitor for certain types of behavior. Log data is regularly reviewed. Additionally, proactive alerts are enabled and triggered based on certain suspicious activity.

<pre><code>Innovation Force has policies in place that require workforce members requesting access to ePHI to submit an authorization form that is signed and acknowledges their responsibility of safeguarding ePHI. The form must also be approved by the Security Officer. Once signed and approved, then the individual will be provisioned access to systems deemed business necessary. All Access to ePHI is based on minimum necessary requirements and least privilege.

Innovation Force policies define the immediate removal of access once an employee has been terminated, with the Security Officer responsible for terminating the access. Once HR initiates the termination process the termination checklist is referenced to ensure necessary actions are taken to remove systems and facilities access.

Innovation Force has a formal process for requesting additional access to ePHI, and all Innovation Force developers must get approval for all requests concerning ePHI.
