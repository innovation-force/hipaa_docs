(see <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/securityrule/pprequirements.pdf">164.314</a>)

These requirements simply outline the need for business associate agreements (BAAs) between covered entities and business associates. This requirement has recently been extended to require business associate agreements between business associates and all subcontractors. That linking, chaining together of of BAAs, has created for new and interesting legal and business questions. Basically, each layer in the chain of BAAs takes on certain responsibilities and certain risks as part of HIPAA, and there needs to be consistency. Case in point, at Catalyze we have several customers that have moved over from compliant IaaS providers because those providers had breach notification timelines that were not acceptable for large healthcare enterprises. We've taken a proactive approach to BAAs to mitigate risk for our customers and assure consistency along the chain of BAAs.
