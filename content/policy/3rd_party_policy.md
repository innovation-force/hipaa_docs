	* Controls implemented to maintain compliance;
	* Written agreements, with appropriate security requirements, are executed.
2. All connections and data in transit between the Innovation Force Platform and 3rd parties are encrypted end to end.
3. Access granted to external parties is limited to the minimum necessary and granted only for the duration required.
4. A standard business associate agreement with Customers and Partners is defined and includes the required security controls in accordance with the organizationâ€™s security policies. Additionally, responsibility is assigned in these agreements.
5. Innovation Force has Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with Subcontractors with an agreed service arrangement addressing liability, service definitions, security controls, and aspects of services management.
	* Innovation Force utilizes monitoring tools to regularly evaluate Subcontractors against relevant SLAs.
