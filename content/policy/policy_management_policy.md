Innovation Force implements policies and procedures to maintain compliance and integrity of data. The Security Officer and Privacy Officer are responsible for maintaining policies and procedures and assuring all Innovation Force workforce members, business associates, customers, and partners are adherent to all applicable policies. Previous versions of policies are retained to assure ease of finding policies at specific historic dates in time.

## Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework

* 12.c - Developing and Implementing Continuity Plans Including Information Security

## Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule

* 164.316(a) - Policies and Procedures
* 164.316(b)(1)(i) - Documentation

## Maintenance of Policies

1. All policies are stored and up to date to maintain Innovation Force compliance with HIPAA, HITRUST, NIST, and other relevant standards. Updates and version control is done similar to source code control.
2. Policy update requests can be made by any workforce member at any time. Furthermore, all policies are reviewed annually by both the Security and Privacy Officer to assure accurate and up-to-date.
3. Edits and updates made by appropriate and authorized workforce members are done on their own versions, or branches. These changes are only merged back into final, or master, versions by the Privacy or Security Officer, similarly to a pull request. All changes are linked to workforce personnel who made them and the Officer who accepted them.
4. All policies are made accessible to all Innovation Force workforce members. The current master policies are published [here](https://Innovation Force.io/policy/).
	* Changes can be requested to policies using this [form](https://docs.google.com/a/Innovation Force.io/forms/d/1sJ_8DcbbW8i2i85pqXU7JrjHLFYBhFj_TP5uAG4QFZE/viewform).
	* Once the change has been approved to a Innovation Force Policy we implement the policy change using Salt. The process for that is spelled out in the Innovation Force Configuration Management Policy.
	* Changes are automatically communicated to all Innovation Force team members through integrations between Github and Slack that log all Github policy channels to a dedicated Innovation Force Slack Channel.
5. All policies, and associated documentation, are retained for 6 years from the date of its creation or the date when it last was in effect, whichever is later
	1. Version history of all Innovation Force policies is done via Github.
	2. Backup storage of all policies is done with Box.
6. The policies and information security policies are reviewed and audited annually. Issues that come up as part of this process are reviewed by Innovation Force management to assure all risks and potential gaps are mitigated and/or fully addressed. The policy review form can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/a/Innovation Force.io/forms/d/1kuyIYA-Z-tmRdfMwrVMl59BujIy9y1dyjMSd8_Wy760/viewform).
7. Innovation Force utilizes the HITRUST MyCSF framework to track compliance with the HITRUST CSF on an annual basis. Innovation Force also tracks compliance with HIPAA and publishes results [here](https://Innovation Force.io/hipaa/).

Additional documentation related to maintenance of policies is outlined in the Security officers responsibilities.
