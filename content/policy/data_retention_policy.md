Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Innovation Force understand and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Innovation Force is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Innovation Force has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Innovation Force Users to support data retention laws.

## State Medical Record Laws

* [Listing of state requirements for medical record retention](http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/appa7-1.pdf)

## Data Retention Policy

* Current Innovation Force Users have data stored by Innovation Force as a part of the Innovation Force Service.
* Once a User ceases to be a User, as defined below, the following steps are
	1. User is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.
	2. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if User responds they do not want to reinstate account, User is sent directions for how to download their data from Innovation Force and/or to have Innovation Force continue to store the data at a rate of $25/month for up to 100GB. If there is more than 100GB of data, Innovation Force will work with User to determine storage costs.
	3. If User downloads data or does not respond to notices from Innovation Force within 30 days, Innovation Force removed data from Innovation Force systems and User is sent notice of removal of data.
